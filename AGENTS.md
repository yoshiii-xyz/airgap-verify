## Scope

Keep changes inside the product brief. Do not add frontend code, hosted
services, cloud backends, telemetry, or unrelated format support.

## Operating loop

1. Plan the change and define a measurable success condition.
2. Make only the scoped edit.
3. Read back every changed file.
4. Run the smallest relevant check, then the full gate at milestones.
5. Record exact outputs and evidence paths.
6. Review the diff before committing or publishing.

## Secrets and writes

Never store credentials, tokens, private keys, registry login files, secret
values, or unredacted artifact contents in tracked files. Treat generated
qa/ material as private.

## Release

Follow docs/release.md. A release requires a clean working tree, passing
local and hosted gates, independently verified artifacts, and a truthful
record of every validation limit.
